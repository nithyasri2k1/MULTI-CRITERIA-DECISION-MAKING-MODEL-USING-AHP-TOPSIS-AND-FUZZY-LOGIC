# MULTI-CRITERIA-DECISION-MAKING-MODEL-USING-AHP-TOPSIS-AND-FUZZY-LOGIC
The selection of an optimal facility location for a medical camp
poses a multi-criteria decision-making problem with significant implications on
accessibility, efficiency, and healthcare service delivery. This paper proposes the
incorporation of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to determine
the most suitable location for a medical camp, considering factors such
as proximity to target populations, availability of resources, transportation
accessibility, and environmental conditions. The facility location decision aims
to streamline healthcare services, enhance operational efficiency, and improve
access to medical care for underserved communities. The proposed methods,
including analytical hierarchy process (AHP), technique for order preference
by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and fuzzy TOPSIS, are exemplified
through practical applications in the context of medical camp site selection.
These techniques facilitate the evaluation of potential locations based on multiple
criteria, enabling the identification of the most suitable site that maximizes
accessibility, minimizes logistical challenges, and optimizes resource utilization.
Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in solving the
complex multi-criteria facility location problem for medical camps, contributing
to improved healthcare service delivery and equitable access to medical care.

Conclusion:
The recommended methodology guides a systematic approach to reduce the number of
alternatives and provides necessary guidelines for the decision-making process in selecting
the most suitable location for medical camps. Capturing real qualitative information from
various stakeholders can be challenging, and different stakeholders may prefer different
location choices. However, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods used in
this study, namely AHP, TOPSIS, and fuzzy TOPSIS, offer a structured approach to evaluate
and rank the potential locations based on multiple criteria. The empirical results exhibited
that the recommended methods are feasible solutions for solving practical location selection
problems. The management can use these results to make an informed decision on the most
suitable location, considering the strengths and limitations of each method and the specific
requirements and priorities of the decision-making process.
